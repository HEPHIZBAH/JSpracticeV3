# JSpracticeV3
This is a Javascript practice when i started my Javascript classes.
it's a landing page interface built with HTML5, CSS and a little Bit of Javascript.
i was trying to mimick a lighting website with a tutorial. it has a switch to turn on and off the bulb.
its not a project Just a rough javascript practice.
Not Responsive but i can fix that if you want.
